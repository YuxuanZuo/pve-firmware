this repository contains the needed lists and scripts to build firmware packages for PVE.

the fwlist files are generated using 'find-firmware.pl' as part of the kernel
build. the script 'assemble-firmware.pl' is used to read those lists and copy
the files from various source directory into a target directory.

firmeware for some wireless HW gets excluded when there is a separate debian
package for that, for example:

zd1211-firmware
atmel-firmware
bluez-firmware
